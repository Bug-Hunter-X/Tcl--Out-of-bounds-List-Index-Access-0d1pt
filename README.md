This repository contains a simple Tcl script demonstrating a common error: accessing a list element using an out-of-bounds index.  The script showcases the problem and provides a solution for robust error handling. The original script doesn't handle the case where the index is outside the valid range of list indices, potentially leading to unexpected behavior or errors. The solution improves the function to return an empty string when the index is invalid.
